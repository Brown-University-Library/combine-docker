<h1>Background Tasks</h1>

<p>Combine includes a section for viewing and managing long running tasks. This can be accessed from the “Background Tasks” link at the top-most navigation from any page.
Note: Background tasks do not include normal workflow Jobs such as Harvests, Transforms, Merges, etc., but do include the following tasks in Combine:</p>

<ul>
  <li>deleting of Organizations, Record Groups, or Jobs</li>
  <li>generating reports of Validations run for a Job</li>
  <li>exportings Jobs as mapped fields or XML documents</li>
  <li>re-indexing Job with optionally changed mapping parameters</li>
  <li>running new / removing validations from Job</li>
</ul>

<p>The following screenshot shows a table of all Background Tasks, and their current status:</p>



<p>Clicking on the “Results” button for a single task will take you to details about that task:</p>

<p>The results page for each task type will be slightly different, depending on what further actions may be taken, but an example would be a download link (as in the figure below) for job export or validation reports.</p>
