Background Tasks
Combine includes a section for viewing and managing long running tasks. This can be accessed from the “Background Tasks” link at the top-most navigation from any page.
Note: Background tasks do not include normal workflow Jobs such as Harvests, Transforms, Merges, etc., but do include the following tasks in Combine:
deleting of Organizations, Record Groups, or Jobs
generating reports of Validations run for a Job
exportings Jobs as mapped fields or XML documents
re-indexing Job with optionally changed mapping parameters
running new / removing validations from Job
The following screenshot shows a table of all Background Tasks, and their current status:



Clicking on the “Results” button for a single task will take you to details about that task:
The results page for each task type will be slightly different, depending on what further actions may be taken, but an example would be a download link (as in the figure below) for job export or validation reports.
